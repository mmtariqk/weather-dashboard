# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## App Description: 

This weather dashboard application is using third party server API called Open Weather Map for getting current weather for cities. There is input area the traveler can enter the name of a city (either just the city name, or "city, state") in the search field. By the time they click the search icon button, the app displays the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, Ultraviolet (UV) Index, and an icon indicating whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc. 

In addition to that, a 5-day forecast for that city is showed below the current conditions displaying similar information. Every time a user searches for a city, a button displaying that search information and it persist there in local storage. In case the user closes the window or refreshed the browser, the search history persists there, if the user click on a city in the search history again they will be presented with current and future conditions for that city. So, by clicking the "Clear Previous History" button clear the user's local storage and removes the history of searches from the page.

On top of that, the UI looks elegant and fully responsive, because I’ve included the following additional components beside the basic functionality of the app. For example, the UI is consisting of Navigation, Bootstrap Carousel / Slider, main dashboard and a footer area. The web technologies I used in this app are html, css, bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX) in the app.
